##Description
These four files in this folder are responsible for analysing all tweets collected based on date, hour, period and weekday. Different from others, the date program contains a module to identify traffic congestion using DBSCAN algorithm, and therefore specifying a particular date in required. And as some JavaScript code is embedded in this Python program, all paremeters related to date need to be manually changed before running.
